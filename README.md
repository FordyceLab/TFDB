# AlexKRotation: Notebooks and scripts for database collecting

**Quick Start:** 

This will allow you to build and clean the database completely from JSON files contained in this repo.
1. Run databasebuilder.ipynb (changing the directory/name as you see fit).

*Optional:* 
These will put in missing protein sequences and uniprot IDs, and fix some broken uniprot IDs from Jaspar.

2. Run missing_uniprot_ids.ipynb (changing directory)
3. Run filling_in_sequences.ipynb (changing directory)
